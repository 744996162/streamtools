streamtools
===========

Streamtools is a creative tool for working with streams of data. It provides a vocabulary of data processing operations, called blocks, that can be connected to create online data processing systems without the need for programming or complicated infrastructure. 

Streamtools is built upon a few core principles: 
- Working with data should be a responsive, exploratory practice. Streamtools allows you to immediately ask questions of the data as it flows through the system (see: [Creative Abduction](https://github.com/nytlabs/streamtools/wiki#philosophy)). 
- In the real world, the character of your data is constantly changing. We designed Streamtools not only to reflect how your data is changing but to let you work with that change (see: [Non-Stationarity](https://github.com/nytlabs/streamtools/wiki#philosophy)).  
- Working with data should not require complex engineering. Streamtools provides a visual interface and an expressive toolset for working with streams of data. 

Streamtools is an open source project written in Go and is intended to be used with streams of JSON.

Getting Started
===============

1) Find a computer to play with. It needs to be Linux or OSX. 
2) Download the latest [release](https://github.com/nytlabs/streamtools/releases).
3) In a terminal, change directory to wherever you downloaded the file. 
4) Run `chmod +x st-linux` if you're on linux or `chmod +x st-darwin` on osx. 
5) Now launch streamtools by typing `./st-linux` if you're on linux or `./st-darwin` if you're on osx.
6) To find the UI visit [http://localhost:7070](http://localhost:7070)
